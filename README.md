Hi, I'm Baer!

I've been working with data analysis and business intelligence for 3 years. During this time, I've set up a small company and delivered 80+ Excel and Power BI dashboards to international clients and companies. My main qualities are the reliability of the data delivered and the visual beauty of each dashboard.
